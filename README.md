## Overview

Implementation of Keycloak Themes for use by the genny system.

## Developing Themes

### Getting Started

To run keycloak on your machine, navigate to the directory and run the following command:

`docker-compose up -d`

Keycloak instance should now be running on `http://localhost:8080/`

To stop the instance of keycloak, run the following command:

`docker-compose down`

### Creating a Theme

To create a new theme, following these steps:

#### 1. Copy /themes/genny directory and change the directory name

#### 2. Change the logo or name

The file `/login/theme.properties` has the following lines that can be edited:

- projectName (string: any): The name of the project that will be displayed in the heading.
- projectLogo (string: image url): The url of the logo that will be displayed in the heading.
- displayProjectName (bool): If the name will be displayed.
- displayProjectLogo (bool): If the logo will be displayed.

#### 3. Change the colors

The file `/login/resources/css/login.css` has the following colours defined:

- PRIMARY COLOUR: The main colour used in the theme. Will be applied to the header background, buttons, input borders, the subheading text, and links.
- ON PRIMARY COLOUR: The color that will be used for the project name, if any.

Change all of the instances of the colour in those code blocks to the desired colour.

#### 4. Change the background image

The file `/login/resources/css/login.css` has the following image defined:

- BACKGROUND IMAGE: The main image used for the background. You can edit the file path to a new image you place in the directory `/login/resources/img/`, or you can replace the image `background1.jpg` with your new image.
